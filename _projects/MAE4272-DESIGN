  <h1>Blade Design Project | MAE 4272</h1>

  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>
  As part of MAE 4272 (Wind Energy Engineering), our team was tasked with the complete
  design, manufacturing, and experimental evaluation of a small-scale horizontal-axis
  wind turbine blade. The goal of the project was to translate aerodynamic theory into
  a practical blade design capable of efficiently converting wind energy into mechanical
  power under realistic operating conditions. In addition to aerodynamic performance,
  the project required consideration of structural loading, manufacturing constraints,
  and experimental repeatability. This work emphasized the engineering tradeoffs involved
  in moving from idealized theory to a physical, testable system.
  </p>

  <h2>Design Process</h2>
  <p>
  The design process began by defining a target operating point, including tip speed
  ratio and nominal wind speed, based on the limitations of the wind tunnel and test
  apparatus. Blade Element Momentum (BEM) theory was then used to determine the optimal
  radial distributions of chord length and twist angle required to achieve near-ideal
  performance. Several design iterations were performed to refine the chord taper and
  twist distribution while accounting for Reynolds number effects, airfoil performance,
  and practical manufacturability. The final blade geometry was modeled in CAD and
  prepared for additive manufacturing, ensuring consistency across blades and enabling
  accurate experimental comparison.
  </p>

  <h2>Testing and Results</h2>
  <p>
  Following fabrication, the blades were tested in a controlled wind tunnel environment
  to evaluate their aerodynamic performance. Experimental measurements included
  rotational speed, torque, and power output across a range of wind speeds. These results
  were compared directly against theoretical predictions generated from BEM analysis.
  While the overall performance trends matched theoretical expectations, deviations were
  observed due to aerodynamic losses, hub effects, manufacturing tolerances, and flow
  nonuniformities. This comparison provided valuable insight into the limitations of
  idealized models and highlighted the importance of experimental validation in turbine
  design.
  </p>

  <h2>Personal Contribution</h2>
  <p>
  My primary contributions to the project included developing the blade geometry using
  BEM theory, creating the CAD model for the final blade design, and supporting the
  fabrication process. I also assisted with experimental testing and the analysis of
  performance data, helping to interpret discrepancies between theoretical and
  experimental results. In addition, I contributed to evaluating design tradeoffs related
  to chord tapering and aerodynamic efficiency, and played a role in synthesizing results
  into clear conclusions for reporting and presentation.
